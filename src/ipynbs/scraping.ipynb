Inconvenience made worse by fact that this was not announced or posted on display boards (I know this is airport responsibility) so I left VIP lounge. As the departure is in different area of airport to lounge (accessible only by a mono-rail and no return allowed) this meant a long wait in a crowded gate area. Flight was full to capacity and very cramped. Normal offer of high priced beverages etc. offered during flight. Low cost option with more service and professionalism than other LCCs.

The return flight on a 23 year old A320, despite the old age of the aircraft it was very clean, comfortable and showed signs of great maintenance service. You cold only tell that it was that old becouse it was considerably louder but the journey was very enjoyable. The snacks are not very good, but I can forgive that on a 2h 15 min flight. Great comfort in the seats with more legroom. Great value for money and going to try Eurowings.',\n",

The seats feel small. One of the cabin staff was very kind but other cabin crew service was not as bright. If you fly with Germanwings, make sure you pay very little money and or fly on shorter flights. The short connecting flight from Cologne to London was good though.\",\n",

Check in was smooth and all flights left on time. Again due to fare type, I was given a sandwich, coffee and bottled water on both flights and the cabin crew were very friendly and professional. Transfer in Cologne was extremely efficient with no need to reclear security and a small and compact airport. Baggage claim in Rome was a zoo, but I would blame Rome tourism in July for that. All in all, a very positive experience on Germanwings and connecting in Cologne would by no means turn me away from flying them again.',\n",

After waiting at the counter for another 30 minutes or so, staff began issuing refunds or providing alternate travel options to passengers. By this point it was quite late in the evening with limited options (plus we were 5+ hours after planned departure). We managed to get a voucher with 3 other passenger to get a flight from Stuttgart to Zurich with an ongoing connection to Amsterdam (flights were with Swiss). We made the flight and the connector (which was held back waiting for about 70 of us) however luggage did not make it. Short of this is the airline was ill-prepared to manage this.

On my first connection to Hamburg the stewardess has told us that we could have some water for free, while everything has to be charged. During my second connection from Hamburg to London I was refused some water, despite being pregnant and not feeling well. I find this disgusting, the fact that a passenger will not be offered water if they're unwell, and will not be looked after in any way.

There was no entertainment whatsoever and the service crew were friendly but nothing more. They charge you EUR 2,50 for 250ml a soft drink like Coke or Sprite, so we paid EUR 5 for two cans, that make EUR 10 for a litre. Nothing else was offered, so nothing special.

How is it possible that the ground staff makes an anouncement about late departure due to late arrival of an airplane 5 minutes before the official boarding time? Wherever the plane came from it should be possible that the pilot contacts the ground staff at the point of destination the minute they leave with delay and from that time onwards it should be possible to calculate very clearly when the plane should arrive. \",\n",

Eventually told \"no flights tonight, maybe one on Monday\" (2days later). Lufthansa and Germanwings staff didn\\'t seem to know who was doing what. Came back to ticket desk at 5am next morning and given overbooked standby ticket for 4 hours later. We made a fuss and insisted on getting a seat (otherwise we would have taken the train). We were given a seat but suspect that others were \"bumped down\" by Germanwings who were prioritising based on who made the biggest noise. Bad karma probably meant our flight took off but had to turn back to Dusseldorf due to more technical problems so we went round the same circle again - delay, no communication. This time we ran across the airport to the now familiar ticket desk where we were given tickets to London via Munich. Arrived home 39 hours after we left Istanbul, vowing never to book Germanwings again. Flight out with Turkish Airlines was a dream, should have booked return trip.  Had to pay extra for Germanwings luggage which wasn\\'t clear through Opodo the booking agent. ',\n",

Informed once inside that the flight was cancelled. Told to collect baggage and go to Lufthansa desk in departures. The queue there was enormous, approximately 60 people in front of us, and thirty behind. Waited for 3.5 hours in this queue. No explanations, no offers of help, no refreshments - nothing. Got to front and options left were either take a taxi to Cologne and flight to Stansted the same evening, or stay over till the next day. We are sitting in Cologne departures.

When I said I fly every week on this GermanWings and its always free I was told by Purser that now they have to charge due to a management crack down.

Strangely, only the Germanwings flight to Berlin was affected, Air Berlin left on time. Delays can happen, but the complete lack of information and assistance was not acceptable. No ground staff was available, phone calls to Germanwings were not answered. No meal voucher was offered. To add insult to injury, access to Star Alliance lounges is denied to Gold members outside Germany when you travel with Germanwings because they are a Lufthansa subsidiary but not a member of Star Alliance. The flight itself was smooth, but no inflight entertainment whatsoever. For the same price, Air Berlin offers much better value. Will not travel Germanwings again.',\n",

This was a surprise since  it was below Germanwings allowable size.  The enforcer instructed the ticket agent to weigh my carry-on. Unfortunately, it did exceed the 8kg weight limit. My only option was to remove excess weight, which I did. I removed clothing and gifts until I reached the 8 kg limit and placed them in the garbage pail provided by the ticket agent. I believe in following rules, but they need to be clearly indicated and consistently applied. This experience was in itself unpleasant. We checked in an extra piece of luggage and had to go to another agent to pay a 75 euro surcharge. However, we were informed that the surcharge would be 150 Euros for 2 pieces of luggage. The 2 agents communicated by phone and eventually discovered that we had erroneously been charged for an extra suitcase. ',\n",

If you want to get from A to B in a cost efficient manner it's an alternative. Flights would've left on time if it wouldn't have taken the flight attendants almost 10 minutes to get a passenger to finally stop talking on his cell phone thus delaying the safety instructions. The in-flight magazine is the worst I've ever seen. It's full of advertisements.

There is a choice of finger food salat nuts and gummibears as well as hot and cold drinks beer wine and spirits. Boarding with priority. Was a little surprised by the food you get on board you can choose from the Germanwings card whatever you want for free if it is loaded. The best thing was the flight attendant who was nice and very friendly. She addressed everybody by name and was professional.

The replacement of Lufthansa services that do not connect via Frankfurt or Munich with Germanwings has in my view turned out as a major downgrade. Aircraft layout (different seat pitch in economy in one and the same aircraft) and classes (no business class offering but instead a section labelled \"best\") seem quite incoherent. Delays are frequent sometimes with subsequent cancellations without explanations from unwelcoming ground staff. Miles & More status is worth less than on LH (no fast lane no lounge). It is as close to a true low cost carrier as LH could get. Luckily there are some routes left where you get to choose (e.g. on HAM-ZRH Swiss operates some proper flights).',\n",

Staff on both flights were efficient rather than friendly which they probably needed to be on such a short flight. The smart fare also included a a drink and a snack and to be honest I wish they hadn\\'t bothered because it was quite definitely the worst inflight meal I have had in over 40 years of flying. The \"snack\" consisted of a sandwich of turkey in soggy brown bread which was totally inedible a small bottle of water and a tiny Toblerone chocolate. I also made the mistake of having tea which was tepid dishwater. My tip would be to avoid the sandwich and have juice to drink. This was really a small disappointment in an otherwise excellent experience and I would have no qualms about recommending Germanwings.',\n",

No value for money and cost are usually higher than alternative carriers. Other carriers offer way better service and value for money. I specifically dislike the fact that on the majority of the flights I have been using seats were broken (once you lean back they recline) and airplane interior was poor condition / not cleaned. On my last trip I advised the steward on board on a chewing gum sticking to the emergency exit seat and asked him to ensure it is being removed on the next cleaning cycle. The answer was that he was not cleaning the airplane. Think that shows the service mindset. Not up to what I was used to from LH I also experienced a large share of delayed flights.',\n",

Sadly this lack of customer service is my experience with Lufthansa short haul generally (GW are part of Lufthansa) which is why I avoid them for short haul flights these days. On short flights my priority is punctuality and here they are sadly lacking. A319 both ways which I find more comfortable than the 737s but that is the only positive thing I can find to say about the experience. Food and drink on board was pricey and not great quality - nowhere near as good value as Ryanair (never thought I'd write those words!). Next time we'll stick with Ryanair - the planes are less comfortable but that's not so significant when the flight only lasts 90 minutes and they are much more likely to get you to your destination on time!\",\n",

The staff are enthusiastic about offering refreshments though - unlike Lufthansa proper - these are strictly for sale and are perhaps pushed too hard.

They are being greedy and looking after their profits and with no care for the passengers who need to get to their destinations or connecting flights. This is an absolute fraud and Germanwings are an insult to the passengers. Horrendous customer service always no manager to be found and just one or two ground staff passing on messages to frustrated passengers.',\n",

Germanwings is low cost and you practically pay for everything you want extra besides the seat. Germanwings has taken over complete service from Lufthansa on that particular route.

Food/drinks onboard reasonably priced. Plane in good condition however I find new Recaro seats very uncomfortable. Legroom is good so all in all bearable for a short flight.',\n",
       "  \"LHR-CGN. Unfortunately Lufthansa's service between London and Cologne is now operated by Germanwings. Upon arrival at the Star Alliance Gold check-in desk I was told I could not use it and was directed to the Germanwings Economy Class check-in queue. I wasn't permitted to use the Star Alliance Gold lounge. The flight itself was ok but the overall experience certainly was not. Oddly enough when I returned from Cologne 2 days later there was no problem using the Star Alliance Gold lounge. If Lufthansa expect to retain customer loyalty they must restore Gold Card privileges at LHR for flights now operated by Germanwings.\",\n",
       "  \"EDI-CGN and CGN-MUC. I have always rated them as one of the best low cost airlines especially now that they allocate seats. However they don't have their own staff an EDI and the handling company can be hit or miss. There is no bag drop so even if you've checked in online you're still going have to join the regular queue. Having checked in on line and eventually dropped our bags my wife and I were sitting in our allocated seats onboard - 10E and F when another passenger appeared with a boarding pass for seat 10F. After a few minutes a stewardess arrived with a computer printout showing us in seats 15A and B. Since these weren't extra leg-room seats for which we'd paid we flatly refused to move. Eventually the stewardess backed down and the other passenger was seated elsewhere. The flight itself was fine and the 'Happy Picnic' was tasty and good value. Travelling on from CGN to MUC a few days later we checked in by machine at the airport and dropped our luggage at the fast bag drop which really was fast. The whole process lasted under 5 mins. Again the flight was fine although air traffic restrictions led to a delay of about 25 mins.\",\n",

This was a chartered flight and sandwich and soft drinks for free. But only 1 round for a 3.5 hr flight. Crew took good care of passengers.',\n",

We paid about $260 US for the three of us for the trip to Venice. No complaints - you got what you paid for.

Coming from Ireland we had to get new boarding passes for the second segment.',\n",

Got to boarding gate at CGN to be told flight delayed for 20 mins 3 hrs later we were still there! Information from staff appalling. Finally boarded another aircraft with the rudest crew I've ever met who huffed and puffed from boarding to landing. Despite the delay no offer of refreshments. Out and home was like flying with 2 completely different airlines.\",\n",

Flight delayed by 90 minutes explanation given on board that planned aircraft had been unserviceable and replacement had to be found. Mildly irritating but fair enough. Ticket included a pre-paid snack that consisted of roll with some of the thinnest sliced meat I have ever encountered but what do you really expect these days on a low-cost carrier particularly on a short hop? Flight notable for large proportion of business travellers. Cabin crew friendly and efficient ticket just about reasonable price.',\n",
       "  'Probably the best amongst the cheap flight carriers. Most comfortable staff are good and when there is a problem they will actually try to resolve it. Despite being a cheap airline they treat their passengers as people and not as cattle as is the norm with other similar airlines. Just stay away from the German Wings Credit card! This is not run by german Wings but an independent company. This is a real pain!',\n",

One thing I don't see in other reviews is the fact Germanwings will charge 7 Euro/kilo for anything over 20 kilos (44 lbs) on checked bags. This can be an unpleasant surprise. Naturally they refuse to pay you the same rate for underweight bags. In the last two years they have also occasionally weighed carry on bags with a limit of 10 kilo. Snacks and drinks are all an extra charge.\",\n",

Normally try to avoid flying them but this was a package tour and had no choice.',\n",

As we did not booked the lowest airfare we received a simple but tasty sandwich and drinks. Inbound flight a 737-800 apparently on lease from Hapag LLoyd. Legroom much more restricted and the plane was fully booked. Cabin crew from TUI. Service and friendliness was good.',\n",

Nice clean cabin the problem is poor leg-room but for a short flight it is possible to survive. A319 on both ways almost full. The return flight was not so easy - at the moment we were boarding they told us to stop because of a technical problem and passengers had to move back out of the bus up to the terminal building where we had to wait next 3 hours till the problem was sorted out - after 1 hour of the waiting time they provided vouchers for refreshment (5 EUR to spend in kiosks around the terminal). Generally it was well organised. I was fortunately flexible and not in hurry to arrive at Prague on time. We were delayed for more than 3 hours with our departure.',\n",

I purchased a higher priced ticket for London to Stuttgart which included for one luggage both ways an on-board snacks. In London they accepted my luggage without any additional charge but had to pay for all food and drinks. On return from Stuttgart I had to pay for my luggage and snacks. It is realistic to complain because it would cost 25 pence per minute. How do one get a response from German Wings?',\n",
       "  \"On two occasions had a very unpleasant experience with Germanwings. The first time they canceled the flight with reference to weather - however when I checked the website of the arrival airport everyone else was flying save for Germanwings. They merely referred to the decision of their company. We had to return back to Strasbourg and wait for two days for the next flight on which they were able to assign us. I had a small baby with me and the new flight they offered was not even a direct flight. On the second occasion the flight was delayed for more than three hours. However until the very last moment the passengers were lied to about the delay. Any attempts to obtain information and to be provided with vouchers for food were left without response. The call center in Germany tried to hide information about the delay saying that the flight was delayed for less than two hours. While the website of the airport already showed that the delay was over three hours. The company's representative was nowhere to be found in the airport. The Germanwings call center gave numbers of the airport service which in its turn gave numbers of the Germandwings.\",\n",
       "  \"Found the customer service centre staff awful. They failed to mention that there is an EUR 80 fee when using the call centre. When I called back to query this I was told to 'take it or leave it' and hung up on. When I complained they denied everything and closed the complaint. To date I have not heard from them again. From previous experience the airline itself is great but the customer service and general attitude is more than bad it is insulting. Germanwings problem is not what it does but how it handles the ensuing complaints. Germanwings made me a very unhappy customer.\",\n",
       "  'CGN-ZRH. Despite the sudden snowfall at their Cologne hub Germanwings managed to keep their operations moving reasonably efficiently. Waiting PAX were kept informed and when the delayed aircraft came in from Leipzig it was turned around in less than 15 minutes. The aircraft seemed almost new and was less than half full. Service pleasant of the low cost variety and snacks and drinks cost no more than they would in a Cologne café. Germanwings has recently offered Miles & More redemptions making it a potentially interesting partner.',\n",

Called the airline (GBP0.25 per minute) was told I could not cancel but only postpone and that I needed to provide a new date (c EUR25 per route per person). I decided to call back with the dates but also noticed a further EUR80 charge. Called a second time queried this with operator and was told 'take it or leave it'. I informed the operator this was unacceptable language and was cut off! Called a third time asked for the manager put on hold then spoke with the manager. Was told the charge applied to call centre fees and did not apply to online changes. As I could not get online I asked the manger to make the changes without the charge which they did. I asked for the second call to be investigated which they have not done.

GW allowed us to pool our 20kg/person checked-baggage limit across the five passengers on the reservation so we didn\\'t have to scramble to get one of the bags down from 22 to 20 kg. I also like that you can pay €20 in advance for a bag up to 30kg rather than get burned at the airport like Ryanair. Seat pitch a bit cramped but that\\'s standard for budget flights; it wasn\\'t a long flight so I wasn\\'t uncomfortable. Didn\\'t seem possible fully to match the better bargains on Easyjet or Aer Lingus but price was still very good.

Well we can do that but it will be €9.52 extra (?). Still it beat Air Berlin and the train by € 48 for a weekend trip so I will take my chances. It\\'s my first time flying a Euro discounter and expect only to be taken from A to B in safety I guess',\n",

Quite good for a budget airline with the usual negatives (boarding via bus and outdoor stairs in the freezing cold drinks and meals cost extra pretty tight seat pitch) but friendly and efficient service fairly new planes incredibly cheap airfares (we paid about 40 Euros return from Berlin to Stuttgart) and both flights on time. Nothing fancy but nothing too bad either.',\n",

You even get a newspaper or a magazine (FOCUS) - quite remarkable for a no-frills airline. All in all always a good experience.',\n",

As soon as one tries to get into the bonus account the answer from the system comes with a long delay. The longer the more advanced one is in the actual booking. At the end one always gets a FEHLER on the page. I have tried plenty of times at different occasions from different computers running different OS and browsers. Always the same effect. The support phone number is also dead as expected even if they warn about .99Euro per minute.',\n",

I wonder whether Germanwings uses special aircraft (the old one) with less seats on these long routes. Outbound delayed by one hour. Return on time but had to wait 45 minutes for the bags. Polite crew and nice flight. Had reserved 9 months in advance so flight fare was acceptable but still far away from the discount prices advertised everywhere. Rating would have been better without delay (almost impossible with Germanwings).',\n",

Looking forward to renewing my acquaintance with this favourite budget carrier after a gap of 3-4 years my spirits sank on arrival at Stansted as a throng of passengers for both this and the similarly-timed Stuttgart flight were milling around the check-in desk. Only one person was dealing with the two flights. This was down to the Swissport agency. A manageress from the latter belatedly assessed the unsatisfactory situation and a second check-in agent duly arrived but it was a close-run thing for many passengers and we were 20 minutes late pushing back. Once on board the experience was good and I can again recommend the Happy Snack Plus offering which is good value and quality at EUR6.50. Return flight was fine albeit 40 minues late - excellent self-check-in arrangement at CGN.',\n",
       "  \"STN-CGN-STN first time with Germanwings. Some confusion when booking as the website kept reverting into German and it wasn't later possible to verify my booking online (so I phoned and everything was quickly confirmed). Outward was no problem at all. Allocated seating stops the stupid free-for- all crush and instantly makes the whole thing better than Ryanair. Coming back we arrived quite early and were told that the plane had been substituted for a smaller aircraft hence they were looking for people to bump onto the Lufthansa LHR flight. That'd probably be better for some people but we specifically needed to get back to STN. Fortunately they got enough people to change and we got checked through OK. However no-one told most passengers that their seat reservations were no longer valid (it was a completely different seat layout!) and so there was some frustration on boarding. But overall the service was good and the flights were on-time. We'll give them another try.\",\n",
       "  'The last-minute addition of £13 for use of a \"credit card\" [it was a debit card] and some other fee with no prior notice at the very last stage of the booking procedure verges on sharp practice by German Wings. The public are not fools. The sudden switch to German towards the end of booking must also be inconvenient for those who do not speak it. These reviews raise many points - do GermanWings take note or act?',\n",
       "  'STN-CGN-STN. My second time on GermanWings. The first was marred by late departure caused by a public service strike in Germany - so not really their fault. However trip back this second time was diabolical. Flight cancelled. No explanation. Lousy ground staff at Cologne. Bussed to Dusseldorf with 60 other passengers for Air Berlin. Arrived too late - no GermanWings staff around; Air Berlin refused to take responsibility. Passengers getting very angry; police starting to take an interest. To get home I had to buy a single on KLM via Amsterdam at a cost of 330 euros. Serves me right for trying a cut price cut service airline again.',\n",
       "  'STR-STN return. Another great flight with Germanwings. They do allocate seats now so you can ensure already during check-in to seat together without having to rush for boarding. Staff friendly as usual. Seats very cramped as usual ! Germanwings needs slim seats to improve the seat pitch. Long flights to Portugal or Turkey must be a nightmare !
