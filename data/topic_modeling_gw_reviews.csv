My only option was to remove excess weight, which I did. I removed clothing and gifts until I reached the 8 kg limit and placed them in the garbage pail provided by the ticket agent. I believe in following rules, but they need to be clearly indicated and consistently applied. This experience was in itself unpleasant. We checked in an extra piece of luggage and had to go to another agent to pay a 75 euro surcharge. However, we were informed that the surcharge would be 150 Euros for 2 pieces of luggage.

No value for money and cost are usually higher than alternative carriers. Other carriers offer way better service and value for money.

On my last trip I advised the steward on board on a chewing gum sticking to the emergency exit seat and asked him to ensure it is being removed on the next cleaning cycle.

Germanwings customer review,2.0,,J Prust,Germany,2014-09-27,Cologne/Bonn to Manchester and return. Both legs of the journey were late. On both occasions we were called to the gate on time and then waited and waited. At least at Cologne Bonn there are seats and toilets at the gates in Manchester we were left standing for over an hour. No information from the airline and no apology - very poor show. Sadly this lack of customer service is my experience with Lufthansa short haul generally (GW are part of Lufthansa) which is why I avoid them for short haul flights these days. On short flights my priority is punctuality and here they are sadly lacking. A319 both ways which I find more comfortable than the 737s but that is the only positive thing I can find to say about the experience.

Had checked in online and printed my boarding card 2 days before but as I had a suitcase to go in the hold I still needed to queue at the baggage drop-off point/check in desk. Flight left on time and was smooth throughout. The plane seemed new and was clean. My fare included a snack (choice of cheese or ham roll) a small packet with 3 boiled sweets (not quite sure why) and a small bottle of water. I chose the cheese sandwich which was ""ok but could be better"". After the complimentary snack service the crew came round offering hot and cold drinks - including alcoholic drinks - although not sure if any of these were complimentary. We landed 1 hour after departure from Heathrow slightly less time than advertised.

Germanwings customer review,,,A Firth,United Kingdom,2014-09-09,I am writing this on behalf of my wife who is currently flying the wrong way across Europe due to the incompetence of this shambolic operation. She was booked to fly from Hanover to London Stansted. There was a short delay and the passengers got on. The passengers were then told to get off as astonishingly the crew needed to finish their shift. They were left waiting for three hours without any information. When they re-boarded the flight they were told they would be flying to Cologne instead of London to pick up more passengers. A bit like one of those cheap taxi buses I guess. Hopefully she'll make it home before I have to go to work tomorrow.

On three occasions now I have taken Germanwings return flights to Brussels. On every occasion the flight has been cancelled on the return journey to Stuttgart. This is because they do not have a full flight (around 50-100 passengers max) and therefore they make an excuse about a technical problem and shift passengers to the next scheduled flight which is also not full in order to send one flight to Stuttgart full of passengers but over three hours delayed. They are being greedy and looking after their profits and with no care for the passengers who need to get to their destinations or connecting flights.

Germanwings customer review,5.0,,A Hicks,Germany,2012-12-18,On a recent trip from Stuttgart to Stansted I had the window seat in a row which was also occupied by a young mother and her four or five year old daughter. The minor took the seat next to me. Once we had achieved cruising altitude the mother produced an iPad from her bag and placed it on the table in front of the child. Then without the slightest consideration for their fellow passengers a Mickey Mouse movie was run with the soundtrack coming to all in earshot over the speakers. Since it was a reasonably short flight I plugged my own headphones in a did my best to ignore the cartoon. Now that such technology is available I think it might be high time for Germanwings to regulate such behavior. Obviously a sense of social responsibility is no longer sufficient. Germanwings usually provides a decent service it would be a shame if they allow selfishly ignorant passengers to spoil it.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,,4.0,yes, recent trip stuttgart stanste window seat row occupy young mother year old daughter minor take seat achieve cruising altitude mother produce ipad bag place table child slight consideration fellow passenger mickey mouse movie run soundtrack come earshot speaker short plug headphone good ignore cartoon technology available think high time regulate behavior sense social responsibility sufficient provide decent service shame allow ignorant passenger spoil, customer,0.0,0.0,0.9822708964347839,0.5964292883872986,0.40357065200805664

However they don't have their own staff an EDI and the handling company can be hit or miss. There is no bag drop so even if you've checked in online you're still going have to join the regular queue. Having checked in on line and eventually dropped our bags my wife and I were sitting in our allocated seats onboard - 10E and F when another passenger appeared with a boarding pass for seat 10F. After a few minutes a stewardess arrived with a computer printout showing us in seats 15A and B. Since these weren't extra leg-room seats for which we'd paid we flatly refused to move. Eventually the stewardess backed down and the other passenger was seated elsewhere. The flight itself was fine and the 'Happy Picnic' was tasty and good value.

Germanwings customer review,,,V Maradudina,France,2010-02-12,On two occasions had a very unpleasant experience with Germanwings. The first time they canceled the flight with reference to weather - however when I checked the website of the arrival airport everyone else was flying save for Germanwings. They merely referred to the decision of their company. We had to return back to Strasbourg and wait for two days for the next flight on which they were able to assign us. I had a small baby with me and the new flight they offered was not even a direct flight. On the second occasion the flight was delayed for more than three hours. However until the very last moment the passengers were lied to about the delay. Any attempts to obtain information and to be provided with vouchers for food were left without response. The call center in Germany tried to hide information about the delay saying that the flight was delayed for less than two hours. While the website of the airport already showed that the delay was over three hours. The company's representative was nowhere to be found in the airport. The Germanwings call center gave numbers of the airport service which in its turn gave numbers of the Germandwings.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1.0,no, occasion unpleasant experience time cancel reference weather check website arrival airport e save refer decision company return strasbourg wait day able assign small baby new offer direct second occasion delay hour moment passenger lie delay attempt obtain information provide voucher food leave response center germany try hide information delay say delay hour website airport show delay hour company representative find airport center give number airport service turn give number germandwing, customer,0.0,0.9817925691604614,0.0,0.5965129733085632,0.40348705649375916

Some confusion when booking as the website kept reverting into German and it wasn't later possible to verify my booking online (so I phoned and everything was quickly confirmed). Outward was no problem at all. Allocated seating stops the stupid free-for- all crush and instantly makes the whole thing better than Ryanair. Coming back we arrived quite early and were told that the plane had been substituted for a smaller aircraft hence they were looking for people to bump onto the Lufthansa LHR flight. That'd probably be better for some people but we specifically needed to get back to STN. Fortunately they got enough people to change and we got checked through OK. However no-one told most passengers that their seat reservations were no longer valid (it was a completely different seat layout!) and so there was some frustration on boarding.
